# # Classes --> custom types

# # Specialized Data Types
# # ^^^ for whenever we don't have the data type we need and we don't want to create our own, we can use these from Modules

# None  # absence of value
# print(type(2+4))
# print(type(2/4))
# print(5//4)
# print(5 % 4)  # modulo - returns the remainder of the division


# math functions - just google them :)
# print(round(3.1))
# print(abs(-20))  # absolute value
