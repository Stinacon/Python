# # Fundamental Data Types
# int
# float
# bool
# str
# list
# tuple
# set
# dict

# # Classes --> custom types

# # Specialized Data Types
# # ^^^ for whenever we don't have the data type we need and we don't want to create our own, we can use these from Modules

# None  # absence of value
# print(type(2+4))
# print(type(2/4))
# print(5//4)
# print(5 % 4)  # modulo - returns the remainder of the division


# math functions - just google them :)
# print(round(3.1))
# print(abs(-20))  # absolute value

'''Don't read the dictionary; just learn the most-used principles'''

'''Random - If there is a doc string right after the definition of a function, module, class or method,
you can access that doc string by using the __doc__ attribute'''
